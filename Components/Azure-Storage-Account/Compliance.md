## Policies that affect the Component

### 1. Enforce a minimum required version of Transport Layer Security (TLS) for requests to a storage account

Communication between a client application and an Azure Storage account is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). TLS is a standard cryptographic protocol that ensures privacy and data integrity between clients and services over the Internet. For more information about TLS, see [Microsoft official TLS documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/transport-layer-security-configure-minimum-version?tabs=portal).

TLS is set to version 1.2.
